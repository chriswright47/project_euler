# find the least common multiple of numbers 1-20
# this problem didn't require coding, just multiplied all the prime factors that were required.
# coding would be useful for this if we were to do numbers larger than 20, and I might come
# back and write a program for this later.

puts 2 * 3 * 2 * 5 * 7 * 2 * 3 * 11 * 13 * 2 * 17 * 19 # => 232792560
